### Social Media App
The Social Media App is developed in the ASP.NET framework, using the Agile methodology for team collaboration. To access all the functionalities of the application, users can create a new account or log into an existing one using their email address and password. Registered users can change their profile picture, description, username, and visibility (public or private). They can also post images, text content, or videos, comment on existing posts or join groups and communicate through messages.Viewing a private profile is only possible through an existing friendship relationship between users, via follow. Users can have the role of User or Admin to ensure the proper functionality of the application.
